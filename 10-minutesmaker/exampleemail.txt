Hello ______, 

I really appreciate you clearly breaking these costs down for me. Unfortunately, I feel that this has come much too late, as I have already been repeatedly and unfairly misled into believing that the $500 deposit would cover all the customs and port fees.
 
From the beginning, your website made it seem like all customs and port fees were included in the $500 deposit by failing to make any distinction between the Chinese and US fees. 

Your Estimator Tool predicted that our Air Freight would cost $1,289.50 and informed me that: “An estimate of customs and port fees are included in the calculation.” At no point was I informed that this meant only Chinese customs and port fees were included, and that US customs and port fees were not. In fact, when I later spoke with your employee, Cortney Koons, she confirmed that this Estimate included the $500 deposit.

Furthermore, the ordering process itself reinforced my belief that the $500 deposit covered all customs and port fees by, again, unreasonably failing to draw any distinction between the fees charged in China from those charged in the US. Please see the screenshots attached. 

This belief was then further reinforced by the quote I was sent on __________. The prices you quoted for air freight (____) and Chinese customs and port fees (____) totalled to $1,459, which, although higher than originally predicted, was still more or less consistent with your Estimate. This reasonably led me to believe that the $1,459 quote included all the customs and port fees that had been previously mentioned in the ordering process and by the Estimator Tool.

Now, you are telling me that the $500 Port and Customs Deposit is not included in this at all. This means that your estimator understated our costs by over $670. This also means that we could have gotten our manufacturer to Air Express this over to us in a fraction of the time for about $100 less. We turned her offer down because your company repeatedly misled us into believing that your solution was costing us, in total, much less than you’re now asking for.
 
This is all on top of the fact that I was initially told by an employee of yours that the turnkey solution covered the pick up fee, before later being informed that said employee was mistaken, and that it only covered half the pick up fee. Although this meant the quote already overstated the price by $50, I let it go, for the sake of wanting to build a solid relationship with your company.   

I know you are not personally at fault. However, I paid for this service because I trusted your company. Now I feel like I am paying more for a service that delivered less. You yourself have been very helpful, but I hope you can understand why I’m frustrated that none of this information was conveyed before. As you can see from my experience above, there was no reasonable way I could have known the $500 deposit did not cover all the customs and port fees.
 
I appreciate that you are a small company that’s focused on improving your service because we are one too. I want to be able to support you and provide feedback. This business is based on trust and transparency. I honestly believe your business can create value, but in this case, it actually destroyed a lot of value for us. 
 
For these reasons, I propose that we meet in the middle with regards to the customs and port fees. Had  Now that I know more about the service, I can see if it makes sense for us to continue this solution going forward.
 
 
Thank you,
Shawn
